 # Stock_Price_Prediction using Regression Techniques
 
1)Data preprocessing: Cleaned the data by removing any missing or invalid data points, and normalize the data to a common scale.

2)Feature engineering: Created new features that might be useful for prediction. Some common features include moving averages, stock volatility, and technical indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.

3)Model selection: Select a suitable machine learning model that can be used to make predictions. Some popular models used in this project are Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines.

4)Model training: Split the data into training and testing datasets. Train the selected model using the training dataset.

5)Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset. Use evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the model's accuracy.
